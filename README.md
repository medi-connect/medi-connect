# medi-connect
Applicaiton that connects patients to doctors, hosted in the cloud. The basic idea is that patients can browse all the hospitals available on our platform and see the doctors associated with each hospital. The patient can then select a doctor and book an appointment, including a description of their symptoms. The doctor has the option to accept the order, refer the patient to another doctor, or reject the request entirely. Often, patients do not know which doctor to choose for their problems, which leads to long waiting lists at their primary care doctor and unnecessary exposure to infections, and our MediConnect system solves this problem by making it easy to find doctors and book appointments.
